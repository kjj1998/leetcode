# Ugly Numbers II

## Problem

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to ``2``, ``3``, and ``5``.

Given an integer ``n``, return the ``nth`` **ugly number**.

## Example

```java
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

## Ugly Number property solution

The ugly-number sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, …
because every number can only be divided by 2, 3, 5, one way to look at the sequence is to split the sequence to three groups as below:

```java
(1) 1×2, 2×2, 3×2, 4×2, 5×2, …
(2) 1×3, 2×3, 3×3, 4×3, 5×3, …
(3) 1×5, 2×5, 3×5, 4×5, 5×5, …
```

We can find that every subsequence is the ugly-sequence itself (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …) multiply 2, 3, 5.

So on every step we choose the smallest one, and move one step after,including nums with same value.

```java
public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
    int[] ugly = new int[n];
    ugly[0] = 1;

    int index2 = 0, index3 = 0, index5 = 0;
    int factor2 = 2, factor3 = 3, factor5 = 5;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int min = Math.min(factor2, Math.min(factor3, factor5));
        ugly[i] = min;

        if (factor2 == min) {
            index2++;
            factor2 = 2 * ugly[index2];
            
        }
        
        if (factor3 == min) {
            index3++;
            factor3 = 3 * ugly[index3];
            
        }
        
        if (factor5 == min) {
            index5++;
            factor5 = 5 * ugly[index5];
            
        }
    }

    return ugly[n-1]; 
}
```

## Complexity

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

## TreeSet Solution

Alternatively, we can solve this question using a TreeSet by continuously adding to the TreeSet, the ugly numbers. The ugly numbers can be generated by multiplying the first ugly number, 1, with 2, 3 and 5. We then subsequently poll the TreeSet for the next smallest ugly number and multiply it by 2, 3 and 5. We stop multiplying when we have polled the TreeSet ```n``` times.

```java
public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
    
    int i = 1;
    TreeSet<Long> set = new TreeSet<>();
    int factor2 = 2;
    int factor3 = 3;
    int factor5 = 5;
    set.add(1L);

    while (i < n) {
        
        long temp = set.pollFirst();
        set.add(factor2 * temp);
        set.add(factor3 * temp);
        set.add(factor5 * temp);

        
        i++;
    }

    return set.pollFirst().intValue();
}
```

## TreeSet Solution Complexity

Time: O(n log n) to construct the heap, O(lg n) to remove the current minimum ugly number and adding of new ugly number

Space: O(n)
